Statistics in Practice
======================

* There exists **true mean** or mu (:math:`\mu`) for a population.

  * ...but we don't know it.  It is a **parameter**.

* So, we collect data about the population and calculate...

  * ...a **statistic** called the **sample mean** or :math:`\bar{x}`

* We make an inference from :math:`\bar{x}`
